My new project, "Bangladesh Complaint Portal," is a website where the people of Bangladesh can report their problems to government authorities. This is a practice project, divided into two parts:
<br> <br>
Admin Section
<br>
1. Admins have full control over the website. <br>
2. Admins can assign other users as admins or remove a user. <br>
3. Admins can delete user reviews. <br>
4. Admins can manage user complaints. They can filter complaints by category, district, division, or subdistrict, and can also reset the filters. If a complaint is not submitted with proper instructions, the admin can delete it. <br>
5. Admins can search for users by their NID (National ID) or email. <br>

User Section
<br>
1. Users can submit complaints about various issues and track their status. <br>
2. Users can provide feedback on the portal's service. <br>

Other Features: <br>
1. Both users and admins have separate profile pages. <br>
2. Password reset and pagination features are implemented. <br>
<br><br>
From logo design to deploy, all are done by me.
